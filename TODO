Notes:
1) Constructor does not assign frozen points. Need to do it externally
2) Check save() function
3) in save_function, make use of save_bin<T> instead of rewriting code
4) load() SHOULD NOT assume that tags is in that file. What is we specify our own tag file? 
5) Fix in_graph everywhere
6) Support starting search from any node in PQ_FLASH and in cached_beam_search
7) Make use of beamsearch instead of get_neighbors for index building
8) Use starting point for the search code
9) support for high and low degrees
10) load PQ data on the fly
11) Use random projections instead of PQ?
12) Add re-direction edges in prune?
13) Check if Windows code works, and also the web service, and diskann_interface DLL
