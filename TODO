Building disk index by merging shards currently needs a lot of working disk space.
FOr each shard, we need to store the index; then we merge them all using merge_shards program to get a merged memory index, and then we create a disk index using this merged memory index.

We should have a direct program which adds a new shard to the final disk index (and also perhaps parallelize this code to speed it up)
