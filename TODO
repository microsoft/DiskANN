(1) Building disk index by merging shards currently needs a lot of working disk space. For each shard, we need to store the index; then we merge them all using merge_shards program to get a merged memory index, and then we create a disk index using this merged memory index. We should have a direct program which adds a new shard to the final disk index (and also perhaps parallelize this code to speed it up).

(2) Merge ground truth into DLVS format?. DONE, see (3) below.

(3) Add executable for ground truth calculation from exp-knn in tests/utils/? DONE. This program outputs ground truth in our format and theirs.

(4) Clean up search_memory_index : remove beamwidth argument, also take in distances, remove output of hops, print QPS. DONE

(5) Add optimize BW code into interface. DONE

(6) Clean up the parameters to ANN interface. DONE

(7) Add the uint8 distance AVX2.

(8) Check Shi's bug: if cache size is > num_nodes? DONE

(9) add linux driver for build disk index with RAM budget. DONE

(10) Update readmes to explain the programs, formats, etc.

(11) Do a thorough walk through of code to detect possible crashes due to corner cases

(12) Connect up index if disconnected by just linking start points or rebuilding an index on excluded points

(13) Try to get rid of exposing internal parameters, such as sampling rate, C, etc. DONE

(14) Need to incorporate SATURATE_GRAPH to handle build_memory_index as well as build_disk_index

(15) Eliminate parameters all together? It is giving warnings in linux compiler.

(16) Add indexing capability with cosine similarity

(17) Add indexing capability with maximum inner product similarity

Workflow:
(i) PQ generates 2 files with "pq_prefix" prefix
(ii) build_merged_vamana_index is used for generating memory index used for disk. can set saturate_graph here
(iii) build_disk_index is calls (i) and (ii)
(iv) search disk index uses (i) and (iii).
