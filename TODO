Notes:
1) Constructor does not assign frozen points. Need to do it externally
2) Check save() function
3) in save_function, make use of save_bin<T> instead of rewriting code
4) load() SHOULD NOT assume that tags is in that file. What is we specify our own tag file? 
5) Clean up init_random_graph, and fix in_graph everywhere
6) Support starting search from any node in PQ_FLASH and in cached_beam_search
7) Make use of cached_beam_search for get_neighbors
8) Use starting point for the search code
9) support for high and low degrees
