Building disk index by merging shards currently needs a lot of working disk space.
For each shard, we need to store the index; then we merge them all using merge_shards program to get a merged memory index, and then we create a disk index using this merged memory index.
We should have a direct program which adds a new shard to the final disk index (and also perhaps parallelize this code to speed it up)

(2) Merge ground truth into DLVS format?

(3) Add executable for ground truth calculation from exp-knn in tests/utils/

(4) clean up search_memory_index : remove beamwidth argument, also take in distances, remove output of hops, print QPS

(5) Add optimize BW code into interface

(6) Clean up the parameters to ANN interface

(7) Add the int8 distance AVX2

(8) Check Shi's bug: if cache size is > num_nodes?

(9) add linux driver for build disk index with RAM budget

(10) Update readme
