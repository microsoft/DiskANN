error[E0277]: `Rc<[{integer}; 2]>` cannot be sent between threads safely

   = help: the trait `Send` is not implemented for `Rc<[{integer}; 2]>`
   = note: required for the cast from `NonNull<Rc<[{integer}; 2]>>` to `NonNull<dyn Debug + Send>`
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::alloc::poly` which comes from the expansion of the macro `poly` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
