# diskann-record: Handoff Document

## Status

**Working proof-of-concept.** The crate implements a full save→JSON→load round-trip for
nested structs with binary file artifacts. The end-to-end test in `src/lib.rs` passes.
Many parts are intentionally rough — this is a design exploration, not production code.

See `rfc.md` at the repo root for the motivating RFC.

## Architecture Overview

### Two-Trait Pattern (Save and Load)

Each side has two traits:

- **`Save`** / **`Load`** — versioned component traits. Users implement these for their
  structs. Each carries a `const VERSION: Version`.
- **`Saveable`** / **`Loadable`** — universal dispatch traits used in generic bounds.
  Primitives implement these directly. `Save`/`Load` types get them via blanket impls that
  handle version tagging/dispatch automatically.

This split exists because primitives (numbers, strings) shouldn't carry versions, but
versioned structs and primitives must be storable through the same `Value` tree.

### Value Model

`Value<'a>` is a bespoke enum decoupled from `serde_json`:

```rust
pub enum Value<'a> {
    Bool(bool),
    Number(Number),       // Copy enum: U64, I64, F64
    String(Cow<'a, str>),
    Bytes(Cow<'a, [u8]>),
    Array(Vec<Value<'a>>),
    Object(Versioned<'a>),
    Handle(Handle),
}
```

The lifetime `'a` allows the save path to borrow from the data being saved (zero-copy
strings, etc.). The load path deserializes to `Value<'static>` with owned `Cow`s since
the JSON manifest is kilobytes and zero-copy deserialization isn't worth the ergonomic cost.

Custom `Serialize`/`Deserialize` impls ensure `Number` serializes as a plain JSON number,
`Handle` as `{"$handle": "name"}`, and `Versioned` as a flat object with `$version`
alongside user fields.

### Context Objects

**Save side:** `Context<'a>` wraps `&'a ContextInner` (shared reference, `Clone`). This
enables parallel saves via `rayon::join`. `ContextInner` owns the output directory path and
a `Mutex<HashSet<String>>` for file name deduplication. `Context::write(name)` returns a
`Writer` (wrapping `BufWriter<File>`), and `Writer::finish() -> Handle` provides a proof
token that the file was fully written.

**Load side:** `Context<'a>` wraps `&'a ContextInner` + `&'a Value<'a>`. `Object<'a>`
provides typed field access via `field::<T>(key)`. `Array<'a>` provides iteration.
Everything is by-reference into the deserialized `Value` tree ("parse once, probe many").

### Error Handling

**Save errors:** `save::Error` wraps `anyhow::Error`. Simple — something went wrong.

**Load errors:** `load::Error` wraps `anyhow::Error` plus a `recoverable: bool` flag:
- Most constructors (`Error::new`, `Error::message`) produce *critical* errors.
- Probing call sites use `Error::new_recoverable` / `Error::message_recoverable`, or
  the `From<Kind>` impl which classifies each `Kind` variant via `Kind::is_recoverable()`.
  Shape/version probing kinds (`TypeMismatch`, `MissingField`, `VersionMismatch`) are
  recoverable; structural/integrity kinds (`UnknownVersion`, `UnknownVariant`,
  `MissingFile`, etc.) are critical.
- `Error::context(...)` always preserves the `recoverable` flag.
- Consumers query `Error::is_recoverable()` to decide whether to attempt a fallback
  load strategy.

### Macros

- `save_fields!(self, context, [x, y, inner])` — saves named fields, wraps errors with
  field name context. Inside an enum match arm (where the variant's payload has been
  destructured), drop the first argument: `save_fields!(context, [weights])` reads from
  the local bindings.
- `load_fields!(object, [x, y, inner, vector: Handle])` — loads named fields with optional
  type annotations when inference fails. Works identically for structs and enum variants.

### Reserved Keys

Keys starting with `$` are reserved for infrastructure (`$version`, `$variant`,
`$handle`). Since Rust identifiers can't start with `$`, the `save_fields!` macro is
inherently safe — no runtime check needed in the macro path.

## What Works

- Full round-trip: `save_to_disk(&t, dir, metadata)` → JSON + binary files →
  `load_from_disk(metadata, dir) -> T`
- Nested structs with recursive save/load
- Binary file artifacts (write bytes, get Handle, store in manifest, read back on load)
- Version tagging in manifest (`$version` alongside fields)
- Custom serde for `Value`, `Number`, `Handle` (plain JSON output)
- Primitive `bool` support via `Value::Bool`, including nested `Vec<bool>` round-trips
- `Option<T>` support via an explicit `Value::Null` variant
- Tempfile isolation in tests (`tempfile::tempdir()`) to ensure cleanup of artifacts and manifest
- Recoverable/critical error split on load path (single struct with a `recoverable` bit)
- `Writer::finish()` consumes the inner `BufWriter` and propagates buffered write/flush errors via `save::Result<Handle>`
- Compile-time `const` assertion in `src/lib.rs` that rejects targets where `usize::BITS != 64`.
- Propagate recoverable errors at probing seams (type/field/version mismatches) and critical errors for duplicate filenames/creation failure, manifest finish, attempting to write to reserved keys, missing files on `load`, out-of-range values for numerics
- Enum support via internally-tagged objects (`$variant` alongside `$version`). Save side
  exposes `Save::variant() -> Option<Cow<'_, str>>` (default `None` = struct), and
  `save_fields!` has a two-argument form (`save_fields!(context, [...])`) for use inside
  enum match arms after destructuring. Load side adds `Load::IS_ENUM` (default `false`)
  plus `Object::variant()`. The blanket `Loadable` impl strictly enforces tag presence:
  loading a tagged record as a struct yields `UnexpectedVariant`, loading an untagged
  record as an enum yields `MissingVariant`.

## Remaining Work

### Value::Bytes Wiring

`Value::Bytes` exists in the enum and serializes, but there's no end-to-end pattern for
using it (no `Saveable`/`Loadable` impls for `&[u8]` / `Vec<u8>` as inline bytes). Should
follow the `Handle` pattern — schema-aware (the Rust type tells the loader it's bytes, not
a JSON array of integers).

### Enum Support

Unit and struct variants are supported via the internally-tagged representation
described above. Tuple variants are *not* directly supported: rename the payload
field(s) to a struct variant, or bind to a local before constructing the record.
Multi-field tuple variants are intentionally out of scope — name your fields.

Open follow-ups: derive macro support for the `variant()` / `IS_ENUM` boilerplate,
and a clearer error for the `UnknownVariant` case (currently a critical error with the
string `"unknown variant"` and no embedded name).

### SemVer Version Dispatch

`load_legacy()` currently receives everything that isn't an exact version match. There's no
actual SemVer compatibility logic (e.g., "minor bumps are backward compatible within the
same major version"). The blanket `Loadable` impl should route based on SemVer rules, not
just equality.

### File Name Disambiguation

`save::ContextInner` currently uses raw file names as-is. The RFC envisions UUID-based
naming to prevent collisions (e.g., `{uuid}-{user_name}.bin`). The `uuid` crate is not yet
in the dependencies.

### ContextInner Generalization

Currently the save and load `ContextInner` types are concrete (directory-backed). Future
work includes:
- Trait object behind `Context` for backend swappability
- Packed single-file backend (sequential artifact writes, offset table)
- VFS support (`vfs` crate already in workspace)
- `write_sized(name, size)` API for pre-allocated regions in packed format

The current design has clean seams for this — `Writer::finish() -> Handle` and
`ContextInner::finish(Value)` are the extension points.

### Specify runtimes state
`DiskANNIndex::save` does not save `scratch_pool` because it is part of runtime state. At load time, we're skipping this field. We need to add an optional `Aux` to the `load` interface to allow for loading code to specify this runtime state params?

### Manifest Improvements

- Record file sizes in the manifest for integrity checking / pre-allocation on load
- Consider preserving field ordering (`HashMap` loses insertion order —
  `IndexMap` or `Vec<(K, V)>` would preserve it for human-readable JSON)

### Derive Macros

The RFC envisions `#[derive(Save)]` and `#[derive(Load)]` to eliminate boilerplate. The
current macro-rules (`save_fields!`, `load_fields!`) are a stopgap. A proc macro crate
(`diskann-record-derive`) would be the next step.

## Key Design Rationale

Decisions that may not be obvious from the code alone:

1. **Why two traits per side?** Primitives shouldn't carry versions, but versioned structs
   and primitives must coexist in the same `Value` tree. The blanket impl bridges them.

2. **Why `Cow` in `Value`?** Save path borrows from structs (`Cow::Borrowed`). Load path
   owns from JSON (`Cow::Owned`). Same type, different usage patterns.

3. **Why a `recoverable` flag on load errors?** Loading tries the current version first,
   then falls back to legacy. The probing API needs to distinguish "this loader didn't
   match, try another" from "the data is broken, stop now". A single bit on a uniform
   anyhow-backed `Error` is enough — the previously-planned light/heavy split was overkill
   for the actual use case.

4. **Why eager tree building?** The manifest is metadata (kilobytes). Lazy/deferred
   serialization adds lifetime complexity for no practical gain. Artifacts (gigabytes)
   stream directly to files — they're never in the tree.

5. **Why separate save/load error types?** The `recoverable` flag only makes sense for
   loading (speculative probing). Save errors are always "something went wrong." Unifying
   them would force the save side to carry unused machinery.
