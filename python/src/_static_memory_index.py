        ### Parameters
        - **index_directory**: The directory containing the index files. This directory must contain the following
          files:
            - `{index_prefix}.data`
            - `{index_prefix}`


          It may also include the following optional files:
            - `{index_prefix}_vectors.bin`: Optional. `diskannpy` builder functions may create this file in the
              `index_directory` if the index was created from a numpy array
            - `{index_prefix}_metadata.bin`: Optional. `diskannpy` builder functions create this file to store metadata
            about the index, such as vector dtype, distance metric, number of vectors and vector dimensionality.
            If an index is built from the `diskann` cli tools, this file will not exist.
        - **num_threads**: Number of threads to use when searching this index. (>= 0), 0 = num_threads in system
        - **initial_search_complexity**: Should be set to the most common `complexity` expected to be used during the
          life of this `diskannpy.DynamicMemoryIndex` object. The working scratch memory allocated is based off of
          `initial_search_complexity` * `search_threads`. Note that it may be resized if a `search` or `batch_search`
          operation requests a space larger than can be accommodated by these values.
        - **index_prefix**: The prefix of the index files. Defaults to "ann".
        - **distance_metric**: A `str`, strictly one of {"l2", "mips", "cosine"}. `l2` and `cosine` are supported for all 3
          vector dtypes, but `mips` is only available for single precision floats. Default is `None`. **This
          value is only used if a `{index_prefix}_metadata.bin` file does not exist.** If it does not exist,
          you are required to provide it.
        - **vector_dtype**: The vector dtype this index has been built with. **This value is only used if a
          `{index_prefix}_metadata.bin` file does not exist.** If it does not exist, you are required to provide it.
        - **dimensions**: The vector dimensionality of this index. All new vectors inserted must be the same
          dimensionality. **This value is only used if a `{index_prefix}_metadata.bin` file does not exist.** If it
          does not exist, you are required to provide it.
